# Project Description: WhatToDo is a cloud-based to-do list application that allows users to manage tasks. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks with data stored in the cloud.

# User stories: 1. As a user, I want to create a new task with a title, description, and optional due date so that I can keep track of my to-do items. 2. As a user, I want to view a list of my tasks, including their titles, descriptions, and status, so that I can see what needs to be done. 3. As a user, I want to update the details of a task, such as changing its title or marking it as completed, so that my task list stays current.
